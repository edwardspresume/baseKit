# SvelteKit Starter Template

This starter template is designed for developers looking to jumpstart their [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) projects. It comes pre-configured with a suite of tools in aim to enforce best practices and ensure high-quality, maintainable code.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have `pnpm` installed on your system for efficient package management. For installation instructions, visit the [official pnpm installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### Installation

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the server and open the app in a new browser tab, and navigate to: http://localhost:5173/. Changes in the code will automatically rebuild the app and refresh the page.

### Build

To build the application for production, use:

```bash
pnpm build
```
